# Alfonso.jl
(under construction) unofficial Julia re-implementation of alfonso (ALgorithm FOr Non-Symmetric Optimization), originally by D. Papp and S. Yıldız: https://github.com/dpapp-github/alfonso

## TODO
- construct barriers internally from recognized cones and set up efficient oracles
- use new Julia logging tools instead of print https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/Logging/
- improve use of sparse linear algebra
- hook up to MathOptInterface
- move to JuliaOpt
