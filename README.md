# Alfonso.jl
(under construction) unofficial Julia re-implementation of alfonso (ALgorithm FOr Non-Symmetric Optimization), originally by D. Papp and S. Yıldız: https://github.com/dpapp-github/alfonso

## TODO
- construct barrier function internally from recognized cones
- hook up to MathOptInterface
- reduce memory footprint (maybe use array views for iterates)
- improve use of sparse linear algebra
